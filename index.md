Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate defective outputs in code generation tasks, ranging from logical bugs to security vulnerabilities.
 While these generation failures are often treated as model-level limitations, empirical evidence increasingly traces their root causes to imperfections within the training corpora.

## 📖 Abstract

<div class="abstract-box">
This paper presents a systematic literature review of **114 primary studies** to investigate how training data quality issues propagate into code generation. We establish a unified taxonomy that categorizes generated code quality issues across nine dimensions and training data quality issues into code and non-code attributes. 

Based on this taxonomy, we formalize a causal framework detailing **18 typical propagation mapping mechanisms**. Furthermore, we synthesize state-of-the-art detection and mitigation techniques across the data, model, and generation lifecycles.
